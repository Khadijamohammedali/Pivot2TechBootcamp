             <p> My name is Khadija Ali and am Twenty eight years old. Currently living in Birmingham.  I studied Accounting and Finance at Birmingham City University. Making a career change was equally exciting and nervve-wracking. I have been feeling the gravitational pull to a new career for quite some time. I joined a bootcamp named Pivot2Tech online.
